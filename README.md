# Learn-ruby-the-hard-way
This Repo is just me working on a bunch of simple exercises for me to learn ruby


I found this website called learn ruby the hard way, and it helped me understand simple scripting logics.
For ruby development I Will continue to keep update it on the go and try to do more complicated Ruby tasks, as the end goal is Ruby on rails

If you would like to follow what i did 
https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/
here is the link, and I would recommned to keep pushing yourself and reading the book because it also teaches UNIX commands.
